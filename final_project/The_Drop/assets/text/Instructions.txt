You feel the rhythm thrumming through your ears, bass pulsing in your chest.
You ride the beats onward, rising with the buildup, and then--
 
->The Drop<-
A whole 'nuther level.
 
In this game you are the Beat Master, completely in sync with the Beats on the screen.
But there are some who challenge your abilities. . .
It's up to you to activate your Beats at just the right time to show just how in-tune you are!
 
These are the Beats, the visual representation of the song. They fall down the screen
and offer the opportunity to prove your prowess.










When they reach the Drop Points, press Q, W, E, or R to earn points. (go ahead, try it!)










Be careful though, if you get too proud and press a key when there's no Beat to activate,
you'll appear presumptious and lose points. And if you grow careless and miss a Beat,
your claim to the title of Beat Master will seem less credible. And you'll lose points.
 
Are you ready to prove that you are the real Beat Master?
