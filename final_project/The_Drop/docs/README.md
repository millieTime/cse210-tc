# **Final Project Plan**
â€¢ _&#39; The Drop &#39;_

- What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.
  - We are going to create a program, like &#39;Guitar Hero&#39;, where the user must press keys, to a song, at a certain time. If they hit the right key at the right time, they get points, if they don&#39;t, they lose points.
- What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.
  - Python, Arcade, GitHub
- What is your timeline? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.
  - Next week: complete super basic necessities. (Stuff comes down the screen, and if you press a button at a roughly-right time you get points. Else no points).
  - Week after: Make it work.
  - Last week: Make it EPIC.
